HOW TO ADD AN ITEM
Step 1. Go To Assets/_Items/ScriptableObjects, and choose an item to add. In this example, it will be "Items/Base"
Step 2. Setup the item with the appropriate values.
Step 3. Add the item to the ItemRegister
Step 4. Go to "Dropped Prefabs", and drag any one of them into the scene. Unpack it, then change the GameObject name to "Dropped [ITEMNAME]". On the ItemHandler,
set the Item to "[ITEMNAME]". Set the Save ID to "droppedItem[ITEMNAME]". Drag this object back into Assets/_Items/Dropped Prefabs.
Step 5. Go back to the Item's scriptable object, and set the "Dropped Prefab" to the "Dropped [ITEMNAME]".
Step 6. Go to Assets/Saving, and add a new element to the Objects array in the ObjectRegister. Set the Name Identifier to "droppedItem[ITEMNAME]", 
and the Prefab as "Dropped [ITEMNAME]". Don't worry about the ID, this will be set automatically.

You are now done with creating a basic item, however, there are a few more steps to make the player able to see it in their hand:

[OPTIONAL] Step 7. Go to "Prefabs/Player"
[OPTIONAL] Step 8. Expand the Player, CameraHolder, and then the Item Holder.
[OPTIONAL] Step 9. Select an object - for example, the "Silicon Held Item", and press Ctrl+C, then Ctrl+V
[OPTIONAL] Step 10. Change the name to "[ITEMNAME] Held Item". Also swap out the child object for the appropriate model.
[OPTIONAL] Step 11. Set the Held Item's Item to "[ITEMNAME]".
[OPTIONAL] Step 12. Go to the PlayerInventory script on the Player, and drag the new Held Item into the "Held Items" array.

The item should now be visible in the hand when held!
